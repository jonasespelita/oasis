    <br />
  SERVICES OFFERED<br />
  OASIS' services are for registered users. A visitor can only view the main page of the website. <br />
  Through OASIS, a Parent/Guardian can monitor a student's (academic) information online. In OASIS, a registered Parent/Guardian will be known as a &quot;follower&quot; or &quot;user&quot; and the Student he follows will be known as his/her &quot;ward&quot;. <br />
  A Follower can follow a Ward, in other words a follower:<br />
  1.	Can view a Ward's profile, grades, checklist, and schedule. <br />
  2.	Will be notified of dropped class cards, shifting, checklist updates, grade updates, and violations.<br />
  3.	Can monitor Student's Tuition Fee, Balances and Payments.<br />
  The following information is taken from these SLU Offices:<br />
  <ul style="list-style: square;">
	<li>Management Information Systems Office </li>
	<li>Student  Affairs Office </li>
	<li>Registrar's Office </li>
	<li>Guidance Center </li>
	<li>Accounting Office</li>

  </ul>

  A Follower agrees that the provided information is displayed in the User's Account pages and is for viewing purposes only. OASIS does not accept any liability to any person for the direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the use or misuse of these provided information. <br />
  If the information on the Saint Louis University's official printed documents differs from the information contained on the OASIS, the information on the University's official printed documents will take precedence. </p>
<p>REGISTRATION <br />
  Without a Ward, there is no Follower. This means that to register, a Parent or Guardian must have a student/s to monitor.  To monitor student/s, a Parent or Guardian must know a Student's Student Verification Code (SVC).  SVCs are generated by OASIS for every enrolled student who does not yet exist in the OASIS database. The only way to obtain an SVC is through the Verification Letter (VL).  The VL is an invitation to Parents or Guardians for OASIS registration. A VL contains the Student's information (Name, ID number and SVC), Registration Instructions, Registration Period. VLs are sent to students' home addresses or requested directly at the OASIS Admin Office.<br />
  <br /> 
  For Parents or Guardians of SLU Students who did not receive a VL or their VL's content has incomplete information, they can contact the OASIS Admin. <br />
  <br />
  A Follower can have more than one Ward. Therefore the number of VL sent to a home address depends upon the number of newly activated wards with that home address.</p>
<p>OASIS Admin and SLU do not require Parents or Guardians of SLU Students to register in the OASIS. The OASIS Registration Letter is merely an invitation. </p>
<p>Security of the VL's content will no longer be the responsibility of the OASIS Admin after it has been sent to the Student's Home Address.</p>
<p>A Ward can have more than one follower, therefore a Parent or Guardian is responsible for any registration using a ward's SVC. The OASIS Administrator and User Administrator can block a user with/without a Parent or Guardian's complaint. </p>
<p>OASIS registration opens every semester only accepting registration of users that have active ward/s to follow and can provide that Ward's active SVC. Registration period is usually 30 days starting from the 3rd week after enrolment. The SVC will also expire after the registration period. If parents or guardians missed the registration period, they may request for an SVC at the OASIS Admin Office. If the request passed the OASIS Administrator's evaluation, OASIS Admin will generate a new SVC for the specified Ward and reactivate the registration. </p>
<p>LINKS<br />
  OASIS contains hyperlinks to SLU related sites such as the SLU Official Website, MySLU Portal and SLU Library Site only. Use of the hyperlinks and access to such linked websites are entirely the user's voluntary choice and responsibility. When the User hyperlinks these SLU related sites, it is understood that the user has left OASIS and is now subject to the Terms &amp; Conditions and Privacy Policy of the new site and the information collected or used on these sites. </p>
<p>Other websites may link to OASIS with prior acknowledgment and approval from OASIS Admin and SLU. OASIS Admin and SLU must be explicitly identified and duly credited as the source of information displayed. Furthermore, the contents of the Portal must be presented in the host site without any alterations. </p>
<p>SECURITY<br />
  To identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or cause damage to the OASIS, OASIS Admin uses special software programs for monitoring network traffic. These programs collect no information that would directly identify individuals, but they do collect information that could help identify someone attempting to tamper with this website.</p>
<p> If one uses this system or Portal, he/she should understand that all activities may be monitored and recorded. Anyone using this system or Site expressly consents to such monitoring. This serves as a WARNING that if such monitoring reveals possible evidence or information of criminal or suspicious activity, monitoring records may be provided to law enforcement officials without any prior oral or written notice to the suspected user.</p>
<p>LIABILITY<br />
  Violation of any of the terms and conditions, misuse and/or abuse of the Portal or any of its contents, and/or misrepresentation in any form, may subject the user to the corresponding administrative, civil and/or criminal liability under applicable laws.<br />
